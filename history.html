          Brief Summary Of HTML
        </h2>
        <p>In a nutshell HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML is what structures and allows, images and other objects to be embedded into the a webpage. HTML is the tool used to create structured documents by the use of semantic tags which organize text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are applied by use of tags, written using Greater than and less than brackets. Throughout it's development tags such as [img] and [input] tags allowed for people to directly introduce content into the page. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, html just tells the browser how to display not what to display.
