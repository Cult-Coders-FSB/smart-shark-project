          <p>The command line is a place where user's type commands directly into the computer terminal. The computer is your ready for commands and can't wait to execute your input. The computer will faithfully carry out the command if it is one it understands or provide and error message if it one it can not. The computer does not speak English, in order to give it commands, we must first start learning the language of the computer. If you run a Linux distribution, and you are only using the GUI, you are missing out. The Linux terminal is an extremely powerful tool that goes well beyond the GUI. Writing commands might seem scary for a beginner, but you will soon get the hang of it. In this guide, you will find an introduction to Linux commands, and additonal resources to encourages user's to use the terminal like a pro.</p>

          <p>Let's break down a few commands to get you started:</p>
 
          <p>There are a ton of commands - simple and sophisticated commands - which you will one day learn. But for now, like learning to add before you learn to multiply, this list will provide you with your Linux CLI command foundation. At the end of the list, some vital information you need to use the Linux CLI.<br>
          <br>
          1. ls -- 
          The ls command - the list command - functions in the Linux terminal to show all of the major directories filed under a given file system. For example, the command:
          ls /applications
          ...will show the user all of the folders stored in the overall applications folder.The ls command is used for viewing files, folders and directories.</p>
            <p>2. cd -- 
              The cd command - change directory - will allow the user to change between file directories. As the name command name suggest, you would use the cd command to circulate between two different directories. For example, if you wanted to change from the home directory to the Cultivating Coders directory, you would input the following command:

              cd ~/CultivatingCoders</p>

          <p>3. mv -- <br>
              The mv command - move - allows a user to move a file to another folder or directory. Just like dragging a file located on a PC desktop to a folder stored within the "Documents" folder, the mv command functions in the same manner. An example of the mv command is:

              mv/cultivatingcoders/applications/majorapps /cultivatingcoders/applications/minorappsbad

              The first part of the command mv/cultivatingcoders/applications/majorapps lists the application to be moved. In this case, cultivatingcoders. The second part of the command /cultivatingcoders/applications/minorapps lists where arora will be moved to - from majorapps to minorapps.</p>

          <p>
            4. mkdir --

            The mkdir - make directory - command allows the user to make a new directory. Just like making a new directory within a PC or Mac desktop environment, the mkdir command makes new directories in a Linux environment. An example of the mkdir command

            mkdir testdirectory</p>

          <p>
          5. pwd -- 

          The pwd -  print working directory - command allows the user to make a see what directory that are currently woring in. Just like the right click properties option in a PC or Mac operating system that shows the files entire location, the pwd command shows the user the entire tree structure for the current file directory the user has navigated to using the cd command in a Linux environment. An example of the pwd is /home/cultivatingcoders/applications/minorappsbad</p>
          
          <p>In all cases, to submit a command to the computer, press enter.</p>



          <h2 class="section-heading">Where Do You Go From Here?</h2>

          <p>There are a plethora of resources online on how to go from Commmand Line novice to black belt in no time </p>

          <p>Let's start with man, help and cat commands</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote"> What did the foiled user say to the terminal? 
          <br>Man I could really use some Help</blockquote>

          <p>The man and help commands are your guides to all possible uses of a specific flag. The aprapro command can also guide users to additonal information about a specific flag </p>

          <p>man is the system's manual viewer; it can be used to display manual pages, scroll up and down, search for occurrences of specific text, and other useful functions.

          Each argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function. The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed. A section number, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual. The default action is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.</p>
          
<p>The help command is very similar to the man command it will display informatioin about all built in commands </p>
          <p> cat stands for "catenate." It reads data from files, and outputs their contents. It is the simplest way to display the contents of a file at the command line.<br>

            cat is one of the most commonly-used commands in Linux. It can be used to:<br>

            Display text files
            Copy text files into a new document
            Append the contents of a text file to the end of another text file, combining them
</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Additional Resources and Operating Systems</h2>

          

          <p>Below we list some of our favorite resources with command line guides, tips and tricks and how to use this powerful tool in Linux, Mac OS, and Windows</p>
          <a href="#">

           <p>Linux and Mac OS</p>

          
           <p>Using Apropos to Search Manual pages<br>
            Each manual page has a short description included with it. apropos searches these descriptions for instances of keyword.

            keyword can be a regular expression (by default; also see the -r option), or may contain wildcards (-w), or be instructed to match the only exact keyword (-e). Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the keyword, or escape ("\") the special characters to stop the shell from interpreting them.

            The standard matching rules allow matches to be made against the page name and word boundaries in the description.</p>

           <P>Using Tab to Autocomplete commands<br>
            The Tab button on the keyboard is a huge time saver on Linux commands, as it will automatically fill in the names of files and directories.

            If we want to delete a file named "whydidIgivethisfilesuchalongname", we just need to type "rm w" and pressing Tab will automatically complete the rest of the filename.

            If there are more than files that begin with the same letters, e.g. "whydidIgivethisfilesuchalongname" and "whydidIeatsomuch", pressing Tab on "rm w" will autocomplete the common "whydidI".</P>

          <span class="caption text-muted"> If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won. <br> Linus Torvalds </span>

          <p>In conslusion Windows 10 does have a option in system settings called developer mode. Once enabled you can begin to turn on or off intergrated functions such as BASH for the Windows environment.</p>

          <p>Just because it is a viable option deos not mean you should do it. Often the challenge of learning a new tool can have users gravitate towards platforms they are comfortable using. If you can challenge yourself to embrace this tool I am confident you will unlock a wide world of power versitlity and complete command of your computer.</p>
